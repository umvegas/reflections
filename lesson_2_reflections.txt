What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It turns an ordinary directory into a git repository. We do this so we can
begin using git to track our file history.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where we build up a group of files from our working
directory to be committed to the repository. It helps the work of version
control by giving us an area to work on our commit in several steps. Without
the staging area, a commit would be more difficult to create logical commits
involving more than one file.
