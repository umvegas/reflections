When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

If I wanted to work on a project from different computers or with other people
in other places.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling automatically might cause problems with work in progress locally. I
might want to incorporate changes from the origin eventually, but not until
I have finished working on my local changes.
