When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

If I wanted to work on a project from different computers or with other people
in other places.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling automatically might cause problems with work in progress locally. I
might want to incorporate changes from the origin eventually, but not until
I have finished working on my local changes.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch is an isolated line of work. A clone is a copy of a repository. A fork
is a clone that GitHub has made of a repository that lives on their servers,
the copy also lives on their servers.
